# Benchmarks

Performance and correctness benchmarks for MichiBoost.jl, compared head-to-head against [CatBoost.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/CatBoost.jl) (a PythonCall wrapper around reference CatBoost). Each script answers one specific question about the library; results from all four together are what back the performance claims in the top-level README.

## Setup

The `benchmark/` directory has its own `Project.toml` that pulls in CatBoost (via PythonCall + CondaPkg), BenchmarkTools, CSV, MLDatasets, and a few other dependencies. From the repo root:

```bash
julia --project=benchmark -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

The first run installs the CatBoost Python package via CondaPkg. Subsequent runs skip this.

All benchmarks respect `Threads.nthreads()` and pass the same thread count to CatBoost via `thread_count`, so both libraries run on the same CPU budget. Launch Julia with `-t N` to control it.

## The four questions

| File | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `correctness.jl`  | Is MichiBoost's model quality on par with CatBoost on held-out data? |
| `speed_sweep.jl`  | At what data sizes is MichiBoost faster, and where is the crossover? |
| `scaling.jl`      | How does MichiBoost scale with threads on a real public dataset? |
| `feature_costs.jl`| What does each advertised feature (CV, early stopping, SHAP, RSM, sample weights, save/load) cost? |

Everything else (shared data generators, metric helpers, AUC, formatting) lives in `common.jl`, which each script `include`s.

## Running

### 1. Correctness

Compares held-out task metrics (RMSE, MAE, R², log-loss, AUC, accuracy) for regression, binary, multiclass (k=3 and k=10), and categorical tasks. Assertions require MichiBoost to stay within a fixed tolerance of CatBoost (e.g., `MB_RMSE ≤ 1.15 × CB_RMSE`, `AUC ≥ CB_AUC − 0.05`). This replaces correlation/agreement gates, which can pass while the underlying model is poor.

```bash
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/correctness.jl
```

Each section prints a three-column table of MichiBoost / CatBoost / delta, followed by a `Test Passed` or failure from the `@testset`.

### 2. Speed sweep

Training and inference time across a grid of `(n_train, n_features)` sizes for regression, binary, and multiclass, plus a categorical-cardinality sweep and an inference batch-size sweep. The goal is to make the crossover point visible rather than reporting a single number.

```bash
# Full sweep (~5-15 min depending on hardware)
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/speed_sweep.jl

# Quick run for dev loops: smaller grid, fewer batch sizes
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/speed_sweep.jl --quick

# Single section
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/speed_sweep.jl --section=regression
# sections: regression | binary | multiclass | categorical | inference
```

Each row prints `CatBoost ms`, `MichiBoost ms`, and a speedup tag (`MB 2.3x` means MichiBoost was 2.3× faster; `CB 1.5x` means CatBoost won).

### 3. Scaling

Runs a multiclass training + inference benchmark on the UCI [Covertype](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype) dataset (581,012 rows × 54 features, 7 classes). The dataset is downloaded and unzipped into `benchmark/data/` on first run.

```bash
# Single run at the current thread count
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/scaling.jl

# Threading curve: spawns one child Julia process per thread count (1, 2, 4, 8)
# and aggregates the results. Use a smaller subset for quicker iteration.
julia --project=benchmark benchmark/scaling.jl --sweep
julia --project=benchmark benchmark/scaling.jl --sweep --n=20000
```

The sweep path spawns fresh child processes rather than changing threads in-process (which Julia does not support), so each measurement starts from a clean thread pool. Each child emits a parseable `RESULT …` line that the parent aggregates.

### 4. Feature costs

Times each advertised feature against a direct comparison where CatBoost has one (CV, early stopping, SHAP) and against a no-op baseline where it does not (RSM toggle, sample-weight overhead, save/load).

```bash
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/feature_costs.jl
```

RSM reports the percent change between `rsm=1.0` and `rsm=0.5`; sample-weight overhead reports the percent change vs. unweighted training on the same data.

### 5. Profile (diagnostic, not a benchmark)

`profile.jl` runs a single training under Julia's sampling profiler and allocation tracker. Used to investigate the threading ceiling and per-iteration allocation rate. Output reports wall-time totals, hot functions (across all threads and filtered to the main thread to surface serial regions), and top allocating types.

```bash
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/profile.jl
julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/profile.jl --n=50000 --task=regression
```

Full flat and tree views are written to `benchmark/profile_flat.txt` and `benchmark/profile_tree.txt`.

## Running everything

```bash
for f in correctness speed_sweep scaling feature_costs; do
  julia --project=benchmark -t 4 benchmark/$f.jl
done
```

Total runtime varies with hardware; on a modern 4-core laptop expect ~20-30 minutes for the full set with default options, or a few minutes with `--quick` / smaller `--n=`.

## Results

The tables below will be populated after running the suite. Re-run locally to reproduce; numbers are machine-dependent (CPU, memory bandwidth, thread count, BLAS, CatBoost version).

## Caveats

- **CatBoost has Python/PythonCall overhead** on every call boundary. For very small datasets and single-row inference this dominates; for large training runs it's negligible. The comparison is still meaningful — what a user actually pays when calling either library from Julia — but the micro-benchmark regime flatters MichiBoost on tiny inputs.
- **Synthetic data is easy.** Three of the four benchmarks use it for controllability, but it lets both libraries reach near-perfect accuracy where real data wouldn't. `scaling.jl` runs on real Covertype to cross-check.
- **Metrics, not agreement.** Correctness uses task metrics (RMSE, AUC, log-loss) on held-out data rather than output correlation with CatBoost. A model can agree with CatBoost 85% of the time and still be bad.
- **Reproducibility.** All scripts seed `MersenneTwister(SEED=9)` and pass `random_seed=9` to both libraries, but CatBoost's internal determinism depends on thread count; results at 1 and 8 threads will differ slightly even with the same seed.
